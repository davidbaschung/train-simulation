# train-simulation
> Trains manager for a real miniature train circuit

This group project is based on a given circuit and railway framework (src>main>java>railway package). We then had to manage the trains, their speed, destination, line-commuting, trains collision avoidance, road locking and create interactive components on the graphical user interface.
